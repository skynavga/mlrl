In olden times when wish\-ing still helped one, there lived a king
whose daugh\-ters were all beau\-ti\-ful; and the young\-est was so
beau\-ti\-ful that the sun it\-self, which has seen so much, was
aston\-ished when\-ever it shone in her face. Close by the king's
castle lay a great dark for\-est, and un\-der an old lime-tree in the
for\-est was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king's child
went out into the for\-est and sat down by the side of the cool foun\-
tain; and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up
on high and caught it; and this ball was her favor\-ite play\-thing.
